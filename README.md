### Changes needed to use the spooler feature in [Unifiedbeat](https://github.com/cleesmith/unifiedbeat)

#### Feb 14, 2016:

* [ ] [Filebeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats)'s prospector/harvester approach is inappropriate for unifiedbeat
  * while unifiedbeat does work **as-is** today, changes should recognize:
    * the volume of data is a lot less than syslogs (given a well tuned sensor)
    * there's only one folder containing unified2 files
    * there's only one unified2 file that is **active** and should be **tailed**
  * of course, the above is all wrong if a server is used to centralize unified2 files from multiple sensors
* [x] add ```os.Stat(r.reader.File.Name())``` to ```spoolrecordreader.go```
  * to deal with renamed or deleted files
* [x] add sample unified2 files in ```sample_data```
* [x] add examples
  * ```clsreadu2.go``` simple reader with counts
  * ```clsspoolreader.go``` to test **SpoolRecordReader**
    * add ```CloseHook``` to **rename** (_archive_) an indexed file
